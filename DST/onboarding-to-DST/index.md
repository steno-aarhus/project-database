If you want to set up a sub project under the projectdatabase at SDCA you need to be registered as a user at DST. 
If you need help with this, please come talk to Kasper Norman [kanoan\@rm.dk](kanoann@rm.dk) or Marie Kempf Frydendahl [maipee\@rm.dk](maipee@rm.dk).

As a part of the security procedure at Statistics Denmark you also have to pass a certification in DDV. The certification takes place to ensure that all users are familiar with the data security rules under Statistics Denmark's microdata schemes and to make you as a user feel more secure when using and returning data. To ensure a continued high focus on data security rules, all users must subsequently be recertified annually. In practice, the certification is done by passing a test through DDV containing questions about data security rules. You have 3 attempts.
